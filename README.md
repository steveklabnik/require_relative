require\_relative
================

In Ruby 1.9.2, "." was removed from the $LOAD_PATH. require_relative was
added to let you require files relative to your current directory.

This gem backports both of these features to earlier Rubies.

## Usage

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'require_relative'

    require 'foo' #=> LoadError
    require_relative 'foo' #=> works!

If you're intending to use this gem to transition from Ruby 1.8.x to
1.9.2, do this:

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'require_relative' if RUBY_VERSION =~ /1\.8/

And then it should run just fine on both.

## Other Documentation

This gem is pretty straightforward, but we do have source documentation,
generated by rocco. You can find it in the gh-pages branch of this
repository or on [the
website](http://steveklabnik.github.com/require_relative).

## Contributing

Please fork the project, make your commits, push them to GitHub, and

Don't be afraid to make a pull request without them, if you don't know
how to test something we can work on it in the comments. :)

To run the tests, simply "rake test."

To install your development version of the gem, simply "rake install".

To generate the documentation, "rake read," and it'll open in your
browser.
